Quota --> total space that user can write
Cgroups --> speed used to write

1-must say  you are using Quota while mounting fs
2-enable Quota

cases:
-----
1-have fs created before but Quota wasn't enabled  on it from start so Quota DB wasn't existed
  so after enabling Quota you must create DB of Quota
2-Quota existed on the fs and was on and active and the you turned Quota off and users wrote data on the fs
  so the Quota in not up-to-date so you have to recreate the Quota

 Quota can be applied per user, on a specific user (ali,moustafa) or on awhole group, you can make a group
 called "data base backup" the one who can write in it are the members of the group "data base backup" so
 the Quota is applied on all team members so if the directory quota is 50G so any member in this group can
 write up to 5G and if all the group members wrote, they all together can write up to 50G only.
 so this can be applied on user or group or on both

while creating quota:
--------------------
1-when implementing quota you need to tell per size(5G) or per number of files(5 files) for inodes for
  not loosing your space
2-soft limit is the space when reached a warning pops-up & hard limit is the space you have, you can cross
  the soft limit untill reaching hard limit

#df -h
/dev/mapper/data-oracle
#umount /data
 umount: /data: target is busy
#lsof /dta  --> shows files opened from this path
       PID
 bash  8309
#kill -9 8309
#lsof /data  --> nothing opened
#umount /data
#cat /etc/fstab  --> nothing automounted for fs i will delete
#lvs
 lvswap
 oracle
 oracle-snap
#lvremove /dev/data/lvswap
#lvremove /dev/data/oracle-snap
#lvremove /dev/data/oracle

creating Quota:
--------------

#lvcreate --name=oracle --size=5G data
#lvs
 oracle data   5g  --> created
#mkfs.ext4 /dev/data/oracle
#mount /dev/data/oracle /data
#mount --> all mounted devices
 /dev/mapper/data-oracle ...................... -->nothing says Quota is enabled when mounted by default
#umount /data
#mount -o usrquota,grpquota /dev/data/oracle /data
  o:option
#mount
 /dev/mapper/data-oracle         (quota,usrquota,grpquota,...) --> settings added
#umount /data
#df -h --> not mounted
#vim /etc/fstab
 /dev/data/oracle /data ext4 defaults,usrquota,grpquota 0 0
#mount -a
#df -h --> now mounted
#quotaon /data
  can't find /data/aquota.group
  can't find /data/aquota.user   both are the DB files
#quotacheck -cvug /data  --> building the Quota DB
  -cvug  c:create v:verpose u:user g:group
 your kernel probably supports journal quota but you are not using it
#ls /data
 aquota.group  aquota.user  --> DB files created
