init:
call services in series
less /etc/init.d/network ----> big shell script file
to run service it calls init scripts = shell scripts
every service has a command to run

systemd
call services in parallel
less /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/sshd.service
to sun service it calls unit files
run services with systemctl
supports init scripts and to work in-parallel with init

# yum search apache
# yum search apache | grep -i
# yum search httpd
# yum install httpd
-----------------------------------------------
systemd:                   init:
-------                    -----
# systemctl status httpd ==== systemctl status crond

# systemctl start httpd ==== service crond start ----> service will start but must be enabled to restart on reboot
active

# systemctl stop httpd ==== service crond stop ----> stops service for now but will work auto. on reboot
inactive

# systemctl enable httpd ==== chkconfig crond on ----> enable service and will start on reboot
enabled - run at boot

# systemctl disable httpd ==== chkconfig crond off
disabled - wont run at boot

# systemctl is-enabled crond.service ==== i am asking is this service enabled
# systemctl is-active crond ==== i am asking is this service active

Apache listen on port 80
nginx listen on port 80
they can be installed on same machine but not running bec. they listen on same port

i will prevent crond from starting:
---------------------------------- 
# systemctl status crond 
# systemctl start crond
# systemctl mask crond
# reboot

# systemctl status crond 
loaded : maksed
active : inactive

# systemctl start crond
failed to start crond service : unit crond service maksed

# systemctl unmask crond
removed symlink /etc/systemd/system/crond.service

# systemctl start crond
# systemctl status crond
loaded : enabled
active

# systemctl restart crond ----> will close the service and will disconnect any connected user and user will need to restart sessions
# systemctl reload crond ----> will not close service and will reload the config files
