Create private and public SSH keys. The following command creates the private key jenkinsAgent_rsa and the public key jenkinsAgent_rsa.pub. It is recommended to store your keys under ~/.ssh/ so we move to that directory before creating the key pair.
Run from shell prompt

mkdir ~/.ssh; cd ~/.ssh/ && ssh-keygen -t rsa -m PEM -C "Jenkins agent key" -f "jenkinsAgent_rsa"


Add the public SSH key to the list of authorized keys on the agent machine
Run from shell prompt

cat jenkinsAgent_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys


Ensure that the permissions of the ~/.ssh directory is secure, as most ssh daemons will refuse to use keys that have file permissions that are considered insecure:
Run from shell prompt

chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys ~/.ssh/jenkinsAgent_rsa


Copy the private SSH key (~/.ssh/jenkinsAgent_rsa) from the agent machine to your OS clipboard
Run from shell prompt

cat ~/.ssh/jenkinsAgent_rsa


Now you can add the Agent on the Jenkins UI (Controller)
