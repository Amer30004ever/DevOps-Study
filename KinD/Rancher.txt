To install and run Rancher, execute the following Docker command on your host:

sudo docker run --privileged -d --restart=unless-stopped -p 80:80 -p 443:443 rancher/rancher
 
To access the Rancher server UI, open a browser and go to the hostname or address where the container 
was installed. You will be guided through setting up your first cluster. To get started quickly, have

-----------------------------------

To install Rancher Desktop on Ubuntu 22.04, follow these steps. Rancher Desktop provides a local Kubernetes environment 
using k3s and supports both Docker and containerd as container runtimes.

Step 1: Download Rancher Desktop
Visit the official Rancher Desktop website: https://rancherdesktop.io/.

Download the .deb package for Ubuntu.

Alternatively, you can download it directly using the terminal:

wget https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-desktop/releases/download/v1.12.1/rancher-desktop_1.12.1_amd64.deb

Step 2: Install Rancher Desktop
Navigate to the directory where the .deb file was downloaded (e.g., ~/Downloads).

Install the package using dpkg:

sudo dpkg -i rancher-desktop_1.12.1_amd64.deb

If there are any missing dependencies, fix them by running:

sudo apt --fix-broken install

Step 3: Launch Rancher Desktop
After installation, you can launch Rancher Desktop from the Applications Menu or by running the following command in the terminal:

rancher-desktop

The first time you launch Rancher Desktop, it will:

Download the necessary components (e.g., k3s, Kubernetes tools).

Set up a local Kubernetes cluster.

Step 4: Configure Rancher Desktop
Once Rancher Desktop is running, you can configure it via the Settings menu:

Choose the container runtime: Docker or containerd.

Adjust Kubernetes version and resource limits (CPU, memory).

Rancher Desktop will automatically start the Kubernetes cluster. You can check the status in the GUI.

Step 5: Access Kubernetes
Rancher Desktop installs kubectl automatically. Verify it by running:

kubectl get nodes

You should see a single node (the local machine) in the output.

You can also use nerdctl (for containerd) or docker (if Docker is selected as the runtime) to manage containers.

Step 6: (Optional) Install Rancher CLI
If you want to manage Rancher-specific resources, you can install the Rancher CLI:

Download the CLI:

wget https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/download/v2.7.0/rancher-linux-amd64-v2.7.0.tar.gz

Extract the binary:

tar -xzf rancher-linux-amd64-v2.7.0.tar.gz

Move it to /usr/local/bin:

sudo mv rancher-v2.7.0/rancher /usr/local/bin/

Verify the installation:

rancher --version

Step 7: (Optional) Add Rancher Desktop to PATH
If you want to use Rancher Desktop's tools (like kubectl or nerdctl) from the terminal, add them to your PATH:

Open your shell configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc):

nano ~/.bashrc

Add the following line:

export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.rd/bin

Reload the shell:

source ~/.bashrc

Done!
You now have Rancher Desktop installed on Ubuntu 22.04, providing a local Kubernetes cluster for development and testing.
