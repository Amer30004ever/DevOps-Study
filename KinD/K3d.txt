ðŸš€ K3d: A Faster and Lighter Alternative to KinD
If you want a Kubernetes Cluster that runs quickly and easily on your laptop, K3d is the better choice compared to KinD.

Why is K3d Better?
Lighter and Faster: It is built on K3s, the lightweight Kubernetes distribution from Rancher.

Runs on Docker: Without issues, just like KinD but with better performance.

Better Support for Multi-node Clusters: With lower resource consumption.

Easier to Install and Run: Perfect for learning and quick testing.

ðŸ›  Installing K3d:
Install K3d:

curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k3d-io/k3d/main/install.sh | bash

Create a Cluster(single-node cluster):
-------------------------------------
k3d cluster create mycluster

====================================================
K3d supports multi-node clusters!
---------------------------------
You can easily create a cluster with multiple nodes (both control-plane and worker nodes) using a simple configuration file.

Example: Creating a Multi-Node Cluster with K3d
Create a cluster-config.yaml file:

apiVersion: k3d.io/v1alpha4
kind: Simple
servers: 1
agents: 2

servers: 1: Creates 1 control-plane node (master).

agents: 2: Creates 2 worker nodes.

Run the following command to create the cluster:

k3d cluster create mycluster --config cluster-config.yaml
This will create a Kubernetes cluster with 1 control-plane node and 2 worker nodes.
