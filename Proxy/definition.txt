Forward Proxy
Definition:
A forward proxy, often simply called a "proxy," acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. It sits between the client and the internet, forwarding client requests to the appropriate server and returning the server's response to the client.

Key Characteristics:

Client-side: The forward proxy is configured on the client side.

Anonymity: It can hide the client's IP address, providing anonymity.

Access Control: It can be used to enforce access policies, such as blocking certain websites.

Caching: It can cache responses to improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage.

Example Types:

Web Proxy: Used to access web pages anonymously or bypass geo-restrictions.

Transparent Proxy: Intercepts traffic without modifying requests, often used in corporate environments.

Anonymous Proxy: Hides the client's IP address but identifies itself as a proxy to the server.

High Anonymity Proxy (Elite Proxy): Completely hides the client's IP address and does not identify itself as a proxy.

Reverse Proxy
Definition:
A reverse proxy acts as an intermediary for requests from clients to one or more backend servers. It sits between the client and the backend servers, forwarding client requests to the appropriate server and returning the server's response to the client.

Key Characteristics:

Server-side: The reverse proxy is configured on the server side.

Load Balancing: It can distribute incoming requests across multiple backend servers to balance the load.

Security: It can hide the identities of backend servers, providing an additional layer of security.

Caching: It can cache responses to improve performance and reduce load on backend servers.

SSL Termination: It can handle SSL/TLS encryption and decryption, offloading this task from backend servers.

Example Types:

Load Balancer: Distributes incoming requests across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.

Web Application Firewall (WAF): Protects web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet.

API Gateway: Manages and routes API requests to the appropriate backend services, often providing additional functionalities like rate limiting and authentication.

Content Delivery Network (CDN): Distributes content to multiple servers located in different geographic locations to improve access speed and reliability.

Summary
Forward Proxy: Acts on behalf of clients, often used for anonymity, access control, and caching.

Reverse Proxy: Acts on behalf of servers, often used for load balancing, security, and performance optimization.

Both types of proxies play crucial roles in network architecture, enhancing security, performance, and manageability.

Applications That Act as Forward Proxies
Forward proxies are typically used to handle client requests to external servers, often for anonymity, caching, or access control.

Applications That Can Act as Both Forward and Reverse Proxies
Some applications are flexible and can be configured to act as either a forward proxy or a reverse proxy, depending on the use case.

1. Nginx
Can be configured as both a forward proxy (with custom setup) and a reverse proxy.

2. Apache HTTP Server (with mod_proxy)
Can act as both a forward proxy and a reverse proxy.

3. Squid
Primarily a forward proxy but can also be configured as a reverse proxy for specific use cases.

4. HAProxy
Primarily a reverse proxy but can also be used as a forward proxy in some scenarios.
