In Git and version control systems like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, **Merge** and **Pull Request (PR)** are related but distinct concepts:

### **1. Pull Request (PR) / Merge Request (MR)**
- A **Pull Request (PR)** (called **Merge Request (MR)** in GitLab) is a **request to merge changes** from one branch into another (usually into `main` or `master`).
- It is a **collaboration tool** that allows team members to:
  - Review proposed changes.
  - Discuss modifications via comments.
  - Run automated tests (CI/CD).
  - Approve or request changes before merging.
- PRs are **not a Git feature** but a feature of platforms like GitHub/GitLab.

#### **Example Workflow:**
```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch   # Create a new branch
git add . && git commit -m "Add new feature"  # Make changes
git push origin feature-branch   # Push to remote
# Then create a PR/MR on GitHub/GitLab to merge into `main`
```

### **2. Merge**
- **Merge** is a **Git command** that combines changes from one branch into another.
- It can be done:
  - **Locally** (`git merge branch-name`).
  - **Via a Pull Request** (after approval on GitHub/GitLab).
- Merging does not require a PR (you can merge directly if you have permissions).

#### **Example:**
```bash
git checkout main          # Switch to target branch
git merge feature-branch   # Merge changes locally
git push origin main       # Push merged changes
```

### **Key Differences:**
| Feature          | Pull Request (PR) | Merge |
|------------------|------------------|-------|
| **Purpose**      | Request & review changes before merging | Actually combines changes |
| **Platform**     | GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket feature | Native Git command |
| **Collaboration**| Enables team review & approval | Can be done directly without review |
| **Automation**   | Can trigger CI/CD checks | Just integrates code |

### **When to Use Which?**
- Use a **Pull Request** when:
  - Working in a team (for code review).
  - Following CI/CD best practices.
- Use **`git merge` directly** when:
  - Working alone (no review needed).
  - Merging locally without a remote platform.
