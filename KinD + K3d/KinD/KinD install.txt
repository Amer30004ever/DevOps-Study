🐳 What is KinD?
KinD stands for Kubernetes IN Docker. As the name suggests, it is a tool that allows you to run Kubernetes inside Docker containers easily, without the need for Virtual Machines or physical servers.

✅ Features of KinD:
Easy to Install: You can spin up a Cluster in minutes.

Ideal for Testing and Development: No need for heavy resources.

Works on Any Environment: Windows / Mac / Linux.

Supports Multi-Node Clusters: You can create clusters with multiple nodes.

📌 Installation and Usage Steps:
1-Install Docker:

sudo apt install docker.io -y

Check Docker Permissions:
Ensure your user is in the docker group:

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker

2-Install kubectl:
To install kubectl, you can follow these steps:
On Linux:
Download the latest release:

curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"

Make the binary executable:

chmod +x kubectl

Move the binary to a directory in your PATH:

sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/

Verify the installation:

kubectl version --client

3-Install KinD:

curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.20.0/kind-linux-amd64
chmod +x ./kind
sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/

3-Create a Kubernetes Cluster:

kind create cluster

Congratulations! You now have a Single Node Kubernetes Cluster running inside Docker.

🖥 Creating a More Advanced Cluster (Multi-Node):
If you want a more realistic cluster with multiple nodes (Master and Worker), you can use a YAML file to define the cluster settings:

Create a cluster.yaml file:

kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
- role: control-plane
- role: worker
- role: worker
- role: worker	

Then run the following command:

kind create cluster --config cluster.yaml

🚀 Now you have a full Kubernetes Cluster with 2 Control Planes and 3 Workers!
