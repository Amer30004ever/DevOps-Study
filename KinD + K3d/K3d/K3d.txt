ðŸš€ K3d: A Faster and Lighter Alternative to KinD
If you want a Kubernetes Cluster that runs quickly and easily on your laptop, K3d is the better choice compared to KinD.

Why is K3d Better?
Lighter and Faster: It is built on K3s, the lightweight Kubernetes distribution from Rancher.

Runs on Docker: Without issues, just like KinD but with better performance.

Better Support for Multi-node Clusters: With lower resource consumption.

Easier to Install and Run: Perfect for learning and quick testing.

ðŸ›  Installing K3d:
-----------------
1-Install Docker:

sudo apt install docker.io -y

Check Docker Permissions:
Ensure your user is in the docker group:

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker

2-Install kubectl:
To install kubectl, you can follow these steps:
On Linux:
Download the latest release:

curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"

Make the binary executable:

chmod +x kubectl

Move the binary to a directory in your PATH:

sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/

Verify the installation:

kubectl version --client

3-Install K3d:

curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k3d-io/k3d/main/install.sh | bash

To Create a Cluster(single-node cluster):
-------------------------------------
k3d cluster create mycluster

K3d supports multi-node clusters!
---------------------------------
You can easily create a cluster with multiple nodes (both control-plane and worker nodes) using a simple configuration file.

Example: Creating a Multi-Node Cluster with K3d
Create a cluster-config.yaml file:

apiVersion: k3d.io/v1alpha4
kind: Simple
servers: 2
agents: 3

servers: 1: Creates 2 control-plane node (master).

agents: 2: Creates 3 worker nodes.

Run the following command to create the cluster:

k3d cluster create mycluster --config cluster-config.yaml

This will create a Kubernetes cluster with 2 control-plane node and 3 worker nodes.
