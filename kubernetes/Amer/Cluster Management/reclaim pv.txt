The issue here is that the PersistentVolume (postgres-pv) is in the Released state, which means it was previously bound to a PersistentVolumeClaim (postgres-storage-postgres-0) but is no longer in use. Kubernetes does not automatically rebind a Released PersistentVolume to a new or existing PersistentVolumeClaim.

Steps to Resolve:
1. Manually Reclaim the PersistentVolume
To reuse the postgres-pv, you need to remove its claimRef so it can be bound again. Run the following commands:

Edit the PersistentVolume:

Remove the claimRef Section: In the editor, locate the claimRef section and delete it. It will look something like this:

After removing it, save and exit the editor.

Verify the PersistentVolume Status: Check that the postgres-pv status changes from Released to Available:

2. Recreate the PersistentVolumeClaim
Once the PersistentVolume is Available, the PersistentVolumeClaim (postgres-storage-postgres-0) should automatically bind to it. Verify the binding status:

kubectl get pvc -n gitlab

If the PersistentVolumeClaim does not bind automatically, delete and recreate it:

kubectl delete pvc postgres-storage-postgres-0 -n gitlab
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: postgres-storage-postgres-0
  namespace: gitlab
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  storageClassName: standard
EOF

3. Verify the Pod Status
After the PersistentVolumeClaim is bound, the postgres-0 pod should transition to Running. Check its status:

kubectl get pod postgres-0 -n gitlab
