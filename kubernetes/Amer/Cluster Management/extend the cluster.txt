# Adding and Extending a Hard Drive in VMware Workstation

Based on your disk usage (worker02 is at 85% full), here's how to add a new hard drive and extend your storage:

## Step 1: Add a New Virtual Disk in VMware Workstation

1. Shut down your Ubuntu VM
2. Right-click the VM > Settings > Add > Hard Disk
3. Select SCSI (recommended) and create a new virtual disk
4. Set the disk size (e.g., 20GB or more depending on your needs)
5. Choose "Store virtual disk as a single file"
6. Finish the wizard

## Step 2: Initialize the New Disk in Ubuntu

1. Start your VM
2. Check the new disk is recognized:
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```
   You should see a new disk (likely `/dev/sdb`)

3. Create a partition:
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
   ```
   - Press `n` to create new partition
   - Press `p` for primary partition
   - Press `1` for first partition
   - Press enter twice for default start/end sectors
   - Press `w` to write changes

4. Verify the partition:
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```

## Step 3: Create Physical Volume and Extend LVM

1. Install LVM tools if not already installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install lvm2
   ```

2. Create physical volume:
   ```bash
   sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb1
   ```

3. Extend your volume group:
   ```bash
   sudo vgextend ubuntu-vg /dev/sdb1
   ```

4. Extend the logical volume:
   ```bash
   sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
   ```

5. Resize the filesystem:
   ```bash
   sudo resize2fs /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
   ```

## Step 4: Verify the Extended Storage

```bash
df -h
```
